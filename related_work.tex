\section{Related Work}
%Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks were first introduced in \citep{szegedy2013intriguing,goodfellow2014explaining} and since then the field has experienced an explosion of interest in both whitebox settings \cite{madry2017towards,moosavi2016deepfool,carlini2017towards} and more realistic blackbox settings \cite{chen2017zoo,ilyas2018black, jiang2019black,bose2020adversarial, bhambri2019survey,chakraborty2018adversarial}. 
\xhdr{Adversarial attacks} The idea of attacking deep neural networks was first introduced in \citep{szegedy2013intriguing,goodfellow2014explaining}, and recent years have witnessed the introduction of challenging threat models, such as blackbox attacks \cite{chen2017zoo,ilyas2018black, jiang2019black,bose2020adversarial,chakraborty2018adversarial} as well as defense strategies \cite{madry2017towards,tramer2017ensemble,Ding2020MMA}.
Closest to our setting are adversarial attacks against real-time systems \cite{gong2019real, gong2019remasc} and more broadly against deep reinforcement learning agents \cite{lin2017tactics,sun2020stealthy}. However, unlike our work, these approaches are not online algorithms and do not impose constraints of transiency and online attack budgets. 
%Finally, prevalent defence strategies against adversarial attacks include forms of adversarial training which can be interpreted as training classifiers via robust optimization \cite{madry2017towards,tramer2017ensemble,Ding2020MMA}.

\xhdr{$k$-secretary} The classical secretary problem was originally proposed by \cite{gardner1960mathematical} and later solved in \cite{dynkin1963optimum} with an $(1/e)$-optimal algorithm. \citet{kleinberg2005multiple} introduced the $k$-secretary problem and an asymptotically optimal algorithm which achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - \Theta(\sqrt{1/k})$. 
%In the small $k$-regime, \citep{babaioff2007knapsack} proposed both the \textsc{Virtual} and \textsc{Optimistic} algorithms which are $(1/e)$-competitive.\textsc{Single-Ref} \cite{albers2019improved} further improves upon this result by introducing a new hyperparameter called the reference rank and a tuned threshold. 
As outlined in \S\ref{connection_to_prior_work} for general $k$ an optimal algorithms exist \cite{chan2014revealing}, but requires the analysis of involved LPs that grow with the size of $\mathcal{D}$. A parallel line of work dubbed the prophet secretary problem, considers online problems where---unlike \S\ref{stochastic_secretary_algorithms_section}---some information on the distribution of values is known \textit{a priori}~\cite{azar2014prophet, azar2018prophet, esfandiari2017prophet}. Secretary problems have also been applied to machine learning, via machine-learned advice which informs the online algorithm about the inputs before execution \cite{antoniadis2020secretary,dutting2020secretaries}. 
Finally, other interesting secretary settings, in addition to the random order model, include playing with adversaries \cite{bradac2019robust, kaplan2020competitive}.
