We introduce the online threat model which aims to capture a new domain for adversarial attack research against streaming data. Such a threat model exposes several new security and privacy risks. For example, using online algorithms, adversaries may now tailor their attack strategy to attacking a small subset of streamed data but still cause significant damage to downstream models e.g. the control system of an autonomous car. On the other hand our research also highlights the need and importance of stateful defence strategies that are capable of mitigating such online attacks. On the theoretical side the development and analysis of \algoname \ has many potential applications outside of adversarial attacks broadly categorized as resource allocation problems. As a concrete example one can consider advertising auctions which provide the main source of monetization for a variety of internet services including search engines, blogs, and social networking sites. Such a scenario is amenable to being modelled as a secretary problem as an advertiser may be able to estimate accurately the bid required to win a particular auction, but may not be privy to the trade off for future auctions.
