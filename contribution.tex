% AM and GG formulated the online adverserial attacks setting by drawing parallels to the $k$-secretary problem, with AM leading the theoretical investigation and theoretical results. Joey Bose conceived the idea of online attacks, drove the writing of the paper and helped AM with toy results. Hugo Berard was the chief architect behind all experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10.  WH, SLJ and PV provided feedback and guidance over this research while GG supervised the core technical execution of the theory.
