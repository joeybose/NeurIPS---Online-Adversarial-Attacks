\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we formulate the online adversarial attack problem, a novel threat model to study adversarial attacks on streaming data. We propose \algoname, a simple yet practical online algorithm that enables attackers to select easy to fool data points while being theoretically the best single threshold algorithm for $k=2$. We further introduce the stochastic $k$-secretary problem and prove fundamental results on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm operating in this new setting. Our work sheds light on the tight coupling between optimally selecting data points using an online algorithm and the final attack success rate, enabling weak adversaries to perform on par with stronger ones at no additional cost. Investigating, the optimal threshold values for larger values of $k$ along with competitive analysis for the general setting is a natural direction for future work.
